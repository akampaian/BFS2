The time complexity of this BFS approach is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (users) and E is the number of edges (friendships) in the graph.

The space complexity is also O(V + E) because, in the worst case, the queue can hold all vertices, and the visited set can store all vertices as well.

This algorithm efficiently traverses the graph to find mutual friends while maintaining a relatively low space and time complexity.
